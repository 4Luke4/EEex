<h1>Overview:</h1>

EEex is an executable extender for Beamdog's Enhanced Edition of the Infinity Engine. Its goal is to externalize certain parts of the engine to grant modders a greater degree of control over otherwise hardcoded mechanics. EEex does <b class="Bold">not</b> make any gameplay changes itself - it merely enables other mods to do so.

<h1>PST:EE Branch:</h1>

This branch is an experimental version of EEex that extends Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition; _**it is unsupported and is only intended to help modders research the PST:EE engine.**_
